# coutdown-timer
Problem Statement: Create a simple web page that displays a countdown timer. The timer should start at a specified time and count down to zero.

In this solution 
 HTML code creates a simple structure for the web page. It includes a `<h1>` heading and a `<div>` element with an `id` of "timer" where the countdown timer will be displayed.

 CSS code adds basic styling to the elements. The `.container` class centers the content, the `h1` tag sets the color to a dark gray (#333), and the `#timer` selector sets the font size to 48 pixels and the color to red (#F00).

To implement the countdown timer functionality, you would need to add JavaScript code. The JavaScript code would calculate the remaining time based on the current time and the target time, update the timer display every second, and stop the timer when it reaches zero.

 JavaScript code sets up the countdown timer functionality by defining the target date and time. It then starts an interval function that runs every second. Inside the interval function, it calculates the remaining time by subtracting the current time from the target time. If the remaining time is less than or equal to zero, it stops the timer and displays a "Countdown ended!" message. Otherwise, it calculates the hours, minutes, and seconds from the remaining time and formats them as a string. Finally, it updates the timer display by setting the `innerHTML` of the element with the "timer" id to the countdown string.
