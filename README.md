# coutdown-timer
Problem Statement: Create a simple web page that displays a countdown timer. The timer should start at a specified time and count down to zero.

In this solution 
 HTML code creates a simple structure for the web page. It includes a `<h1>` heading and a `<div>` element with an `id` of "timer" where the countdown timer will be displayed.

 CSS code adds basic styling to the elements. The `.container` class centers the content, the `h1` tag sets the color to a dark gray (#333), and the `#timer` selector sets the font size to 48 pixels and the color to red (#F00).
